# Assignment 02 - Functions, Modules and Error Handling

---

## 1. Understanding Functions

Write a Python program to:

- Explain the purpose of a function in Python.
- Provide an example where a function simplifies repetitive tasks.

### Practical Task:
Create a function named `compute_basic_stats()` that:

- Accepts a list of numbers
- Returns a dictionary containing:
  - Minimum value
  - Maximum value
  - Average value

Use the sample data:
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

---

## 2. Exploring Modules

Write a short explanation about how Python modules improve code organization and reusability.

### Practical Task:
Create a custom module named `math_tools.py` that includes functions for:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Test the module using:
num1 = 5  
num2 = 3  

---

## 3. Error Handling

Explain what exception handling is in Python and why it is important.

### Practical Task:
Modify your division function to handle:

- Division by zero
- Invalid input types

Test using:
num1 = "ten"  
num2 = 5  

---

## 4. Integrating Functions, Modules and Error Handling

Explain how functions, modules, and error handling work together to improve program structure.

### Practical Task:
Develop a Python script that:

- Reads numbers from a file
- Performs arithmetic operations
- Handles:
  - Missing file errors
  - Invalid data format errors

---

## 5. Real-World Application

Describe a real-world scenario where robust error handling is critical.

### Practical Task:
Create a basic data processing application that:

- Cleans numeric data
- Calculates statistical measures
- Handles:
  - Missing values
  - Invalid inputs

Use sample dataset:
[10, 20, 30, 40, None, 50, "N/A", 60]
