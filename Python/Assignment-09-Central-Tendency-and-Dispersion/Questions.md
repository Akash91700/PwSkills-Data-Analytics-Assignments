## Q1: Understanding Central Tendency

**Question:**  
A company tracks the daily production of widgets (in units) over a week:  
[120, 150, 145, 160, 155, 150, 145].

## Q2: Mean in Real Life

**Question:**  
A teacher calculates the average score of her class from test scores:  
[78, 85, 90, 87, 88, 92, 95].  
What is the mean test score, and what does it signify?

## Q3: Median in Real Life

**Question:**  
A real estate agent compares house prices in a neighborhood:  
[$250k, $300k, $320k, $280k, $3M].

## Q5: Dispersion Introduction

**Question:**  
A student measures the time taken to complete daily homework:  
[30 min, 35 min, 28 min, 40 min, 45 min].  
What does the range tell us about the student’s homework time variability?

## Q6: Range in Action

**Question:**  
A farmer tracks the daily temperature of his greenhouse:  
[15°C, 18°C, 20°C, 22°C, 25°C].  
What is the range, and what might this tell us about greenhouse management?

## Q7: Variance for Decision-Making

**Question:**  
Two factories produce light bulbs.  
Factory A has a variance of 4 in lifespan data, and Factory B has a variance of 10.  
Which factory produces more consistent bulbs, and why?

---

## Q8: Standard Deviation in Context

**Question:**  
A finance manager compares stock price volatility for two stocks.  
Stock A has a standard deviation of $5, and Stock B has $15.  
Which stock is riskier, and how is this determined?

---

## Q9: Combining Measures

**Question:**  
A city council measures weekly water usage (in gallons):  
[500, 520, 480, 530, 510].  
Compute the mean and standard deviation.  
What do these measures tell you about water usage?

## Q10: Central Tendency in Health

**Question:**  
A doctor monitors the recovery times (in days) of patients after surgery:  
[7, 8, 7, 9, 8, 10, 7].  
Which measure (mean, median, or mode) best represents typical recovery time and why?

---

## Q11: Outliers in Real-Life Data

**Question:**  
A restaurant monitors daily customer tips (in $):  
[10, 12, 15, 11, 200].  
Why might the median be a better measure of central tendency than the mean?

---

## Q12: Comparing Datasets

**Question:**  
Two classes have test scores.  
Class A: [75, 78, 80, 85, 90]  
Class B: [70, 72, 90, 95, 100]  
Which class has a larger range?  
What does this indicate about variability?

---

## Q13: Skewed Data

**Question:**  
Monthly income of workers in a factory is recorded.  
Most workers earn around $3,000, but the manager earns $10,000.  
How does this affect the mean, median, and mode?  
Which measure best represents central tendency?

---

## Q14: Application in Business

**Question:**  
A retail store tracks weekly sales of a product:  
[150, 200, 250, 300, 350].  
Compute the variance and standard deviation.  
How can these values help the store forecast future sales?

## Q15: Practical Application

**Question:**  
A sports analyst tracks the performance of a player over 10 games (scores):  
[20, 22, 18, 25, 30, 15, 20].  
Identify the mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation.  
What insights do these measures provide about the player’s performance?
