# Assignment 07 - Titanic Data Visualization

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3
- NumPy — for numerical operations
- Pandas — for data manipulation
- Matplotlib / Seaborn — for visualizations

---

## Task 1: Load Dataset
1. Load the `titanic` dataset using seaborn's `load_dataset()` function.
2. Display the first 5 rows.
3. How many rows and columns does the dataset contain?

---

## Task 2: Bar Chart
1. Create a bar chart showing the number of passengers in each class (`pclass`).
2. Add axis labels and a title.

---

## Task 3: Boxplot
1. Plot a boxplot of `age` across passenger classes (`pclass`).
2. What does the visualization reveal about age distribution?

---

## Task 4: Heatmap
1. Create a heatmap showing correlations among numerical columns (`age`, `fare`, `sibsp`, `parch`).
2. Which two features are most strongly correlated?

---

## Task 5: Pie Chart
1. Create a pie chart showing the proportion of passengers who survived vs those who did not (`survived`).
2. Add percentages to each slice.

---

## Task 6: Scatterplot
1. Create a scatterplot of `age` vs `fare`, colored by `sex`.
2. What patterns can you observe in gender distribution?

---

## Task 7: Histogram
1. Plot a histogram of `age` using bins of size 10.
2. What does the age distribution look like?

---

## Task 8: Line Chart
1. Group the dataset by `age` and calculate the average `fare` for each age.
2. Plot a line chart showing trend of `fare` vs `age`.
