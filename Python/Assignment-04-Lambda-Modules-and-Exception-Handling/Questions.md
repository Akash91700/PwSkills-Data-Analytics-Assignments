# Assignment 04 - Lambda Functions, Modules and Exception Handling

---

## Easy Level

### 1. Lambda Function Basics

What is a lambda function in Python?  
Write two reasons why lambda functions are useful.

---

### 2. Square Using Lambda

Write a lambda function that takes a number and returns its square.

Test Input:
number = 5

Expected Output:
25

---

### 3. Using Math Module

Write a Python program to import the `math` module and print the value of pi.

Expected Output:
3.141592653589793

---

## Medium Level

### 4. Double Numbers Using Lambda

Write a Python program to use a lambda function to double all numbers in the list:

[2, 4, 6, 8]

Expected Output:
[4, 8, 12, 16]

---

### 5. Division with Exception Handling

Write a Python program that asks the user to divide two numbers.  
Handle division by zero using try-except.

Test Input:
Number 1 = 10  
Number 2 = 0  

Expected Output:
Error: Cannot divide by zero.

---

### 6. Random Number Generator

Write a Python program to use the `random` module to print a random number between 1 and 10.

Example Output:
A number between 1 and 10 (e.g., 7)

---

## Hard Level

### 7. Filter Even Numbers Using Lambda

Write a Python program to use a lambda function with `filter()` to extract even numbers from the list:

[3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]

Expected Output:
[6, 12, 18]

---

### 8. Advanced Exception Handling

Write a program to take two inputs from the user and divide them.  
Handle both:

- ValueError (if input is not a number)
- ZeroDivisionError

Test Input:
Number 1 = "abc"  
Number 2 = 0  

Expected Output:
Error: Invalid input. Please enter numbers only.  
Error: Cannot divide by zero.

---

### 9. Custom Module Creation

Create a Python module named `my_module.py` with a function:

greet(name)

The function should print:

Hello, <name>!

Then write a program to import this module and call the function with:

name = "Aman"

Expected Output:
Hello, Aman!
