# SQL Assignment – Basic and Advanced Concepts

## What is SQL?

SQL stands for **Structured Query Language**. It is the standard language used to communicate with relational databases, allowing you to store, retrieve, update, and manipulate data stored in database tables. SQL syntax is used across multiple database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and SQLite. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Relational databases organize data in rows and columns, and SQL helps to manage this data efficiently using commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and many more. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 📌 SQL Basics

These are fundamental SQL skills every beginner should know:

### 🔹 Core Concepts
- **SELECT** – Retrieve data from one or more tables. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **WHERE** – Filter results based on conditions.  
- **ORDER BY** – Sort the results.  
- **GROUP BY** – Aggregate grouped data.  
- **INSERT** – Add new rows.  
- **UPDATE** – Modify existing data.  
- **DELETE** – Remove records.

SQL basics are about *reading and manipulating data* from table structures and forming simple yet powerful queries to answer data questions. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## 🚀 Advanced SQL

After mastering the basics, you can explore advanced SQL features that are widely used in real-world data processing and analytics:

### 🔸 Key Advanced Concepts
- **Window Functions** – e.g., `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`  
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** – Reusable temporary result sets. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Recursive Queries** – For hierarchical or tree-structured data. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Subqueries and Correlated Queries** – Nested queries for complex filtering.  
- **Pivoting and Aggregations** – Transforming rows to columns.  
- **Advanced Joins** – Self-joins, outer joins, etc.  
- **Performance Optimizations** – Execution plans, indexing hints, and tuning.

These advanced techniques are important for analytical queries, reporting, BI dashboards, and production-level database solutions. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
